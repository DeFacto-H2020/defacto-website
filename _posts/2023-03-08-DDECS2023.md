Many recent pattern recognition applications rely on
complex distributed architectures in which sensing and computational nodes 
interact together through a communication network.
Deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role in this
scenario, furnishing powerful decision mechanisms, at the price
of a high computational effort. Consequently, powerful state-of-
the-art DNNs frequently are split over various computational
nodes, e.g., a first part stays on an embedded device and the
rest on a server. Deciding where to split a DNN is a challenge
in itself, making the design of deep learning applications even
more complicated. Therefore, this paper proposes Split-Et-Impera, a novel
and practical framework that i) determines the set of the
best-split points of a neural network based on deep network
interpretability principles without performing a tedious try-and-
test approach, ii) performs a communication-aware simulation for
the rapid evaluation of different neural network rearrangements,
and iii) suggests the best match between the quality of service
requirements of the application and the performance in terms of
accuracy and latency time.
