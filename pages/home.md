The manufacturing world is experiencing what many recognize as “the fourth 
industrial revolution”, characterized by production lines turning into complex 
cyber-physical systems (CPSs). This transformation offers unprecedented 
opportunities but brings a series of intellectual and engineering challenges. 
The **DeFacto** (**De**sign Automation for Smart **Facto**ries)
project aims at advancing 
the field of CPS design and its automation by developing novel modeling 
paradigms, scalable algorithms, and tools to aid the design of smart 
manufacturing systems, ultimately fostering their widespread adoption.

DeFacto’s methodology reasons about systems using reliable compositional 
abstractions of system behaviors based on assume-guarantee (A/G) contracts. 
An A/G contract represents the interface of a component as a pair of assumptions
and guarantees. Assumptions are the behaviors that a component expects from the
environment; guarantees are the behaviors the component promises in the context
of the assumptions. Contracts are mathematical models that provide rigorous
composition rules and mechanisms to analyze complex system behaviors, validate
the design requirements, and develop system components in a modular and
hierarchical way. CPSs challenge the existing notions of “modularity”,
“hierarchy”, and “separation of concerns” in electronic design. DeFacto rethinks
these notions to enable effective and computationally tractable compositional 
abstractions for industrial CPSs, by blending techniques from formal methods, 
simulation, and optimization for virtual prototyping and algorithmic synthesis 
of control software.
