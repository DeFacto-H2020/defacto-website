A Work-in-Progress and demo about CHASE has been accepted at the 
[2022 CPS-IoT Week](http://www.cpsweek.org/){:target="_blank"}.
The contribution authored by *Michele Lora* and *Pierluigi Nuzzo*, and
titled **A Contract-Based Requirement Engineering Framework for the
Design of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems**, is inserted in the program of
the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems.

This work-in-progress paper presents our current effort toward the development 
of compositional modeling formalisms and scalable algorithms for
high-assurance design of industrial cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on
smart manufacturing systems. A requirement engineering methodology is
implemented within CHASE, a software framework supporting contract-based
representations of systems and components to facilitate analysis and design
space exploration. We provide an overview of CHASE and discuss its
application to the design of a robotic arm.

This paper is accompanied by a poster describing the architecture of CHASE and
a demonstration of its application to the case study.
