This paper presents a software architecture extending the classical automation pyramid
to control and reconfigure flexible, service-oriented manufacturing systems.
At the Planning level, the architecture requires 
a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) consistent with the 
International Society Automation (ISA) standard.
Then, the Supervisory level is automated by introducing a novel component, called
Automation Manager. 
The new component interacts upward with the MES, and
downward with a set of servers providing access to the manufacturing
machines.
The communication with machines relies on the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)
standard protocol, which allows exposing production tasks as
``services''.

The proposed software architecture has been prototyped to control a real
production line, originally controlled by a commercial MES, unable to fully
exploit the flexibility provided by the case study manufacturing system.
Meanwhile, the proposed architecture is fully exploiting the production line's
flexibility.
