This paper proposes an automated framework for quantitative verification and 
design space exploration of cyber-physical systems in the presence of 
uncertainty, leveraging assume-guarantee con- tracts expressed in Stochastic 
Signal Temporal Logic (StSTL). We introduce quantitative semantics for StSTL 
and formulations of the quantitative verification and design space exploration 
problems as bi-level optimization problems. We show that these optimization 
problems can be effectively solved for a class of stochastic systems and a 
fragment of bounded-time StSTL formulas. Our algorithm searches for partitions 
of the upper-level design space such that the solutions of the lower-level 
problems satisfy the upper-level constraints. A set of optimal parameter values 
are then selected within these partitions. We illustrate the effectiveness of 
our framework on the design of a multi-sensor perception system and an 
automatic cruise control system.
