The paper titled **Enabling Component Reuse in Model-based System Engineering of
Cyber-Physical Production Systems**, authored by *Stefano Spellini*, *Sebastiano
Gaiardelli*, *Michele Lora* and *Franco Fummi*, has been accepted at the
[26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory 
Automation (ETFA 2021)](https://2021.ieee-etfa.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In this work, we outline a design flow contemplating the reuse of already
existing manufacturing lines' models, while designing novel advanced production
systems. To enable such a flow, we propose a methodology extracting
System Modeling Language (SysML) structural diagrams from AutomationML descriptions.
Then, we propose to design the system functionalities on top of the produced 
diagrams.

The paper shows the application of the methodology to a concrete manufacturing
line, the structure of which was originally modeled using AutomationML. To
exemplify the advantages of the methodology, we exploit the models being
generated to automatically extract a digital twin for the production system
transportation line. The resulting digital twin is compliant with a well-known
plant simulation tool.
